# XIVAPI Mog

This is Mog, the discord bot in the XIVAPI server. He is still a work-in-progress but there are not many bots built in PHP so this is quite fun!

Run as:
- `php bin/console RunCommand`

In discord do @mog and then follow the chain of messages. The bot is intended to be a natural language responder rather than remembering to do ".xxx" or w/e for commands.
